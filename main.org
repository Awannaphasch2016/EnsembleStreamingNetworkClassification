* Introduction
# Start to draw a system framework, which shows the complete framework of your ensemble approach for streaming graph prediction.

# What are streaming graphs (dynamic nodes, edges et.c)? what are streaming graphs applications? Why streaming graphs are important
Dunamic graph is vaguely used term. In general, dynamic graph is an ordered list of node and link events. These events include deletion and addition of nodes and edges after a interval of time.
Dynamic graph is known in other named as streaming graph and temporal graph. Concretely, dynamic graph can be categorized into subcategories [[cite:&barrosSurveyEmbeddingDynamic2021;&kazemiRepresentationLearningDynamica;&skardingFoundationsModelingDynamic2021]].

# For streaming graphs, what are analytics objective (or learning objective)? E.g., node classification, link prediction?
# For static graph (no st[[cite:&skardinga2021foundations]]reaming or changing edges), what are typical link prediction or node classification solutions. What are challenges, if network is dynamically changing?
# What are graph embedding learning, what are challenges if graphs are dynamically changing?
# What are the main motivation of the proposed research? What are the overall framework of the proposed design?
# What are brief results of the proposed design.
