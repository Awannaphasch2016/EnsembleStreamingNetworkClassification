  abstract = {Embedding static graphs in low-dimensional vector spaces plays a key role in network analytics and inference, supporting applications like node classification, link prediction, and graph visualization. However, many real-world networks present dynamic behavior, including topological evolution, feature evolution, and diffusion. Therefore, several methods for embedding dynamic graphs have been proposed to learn network representations over time, facing novel challenges, such as time-domain modeling, temporal features to be captured, and the temporal granularity to be embedded. In this survey, we overview dynamic graph embedding, discussing its fundamentals and the recent advances developed so far. We introduce the formal definition of dynamic graph embedding, focusing on the problem setting and introducing a novel taxonomy for dynamic graph embedding input and output. We further explore different dynamic behaviors that may be encompassed by embeddings, classifying by topological evolution, feature evolution, and processes on networks. Afterward, we describe existing techniques and propose a taxonomy for dynamic graph embedding techniques based on algorithmic approaches, from matrix and tensor factorization to deep learning, random walks, and temporal point processes. We also elucidate main applications, including dynamic link prediction, anomaly detection, and diffusion prediction, and we further state some promising research directions in the area.},

  abstract = {Graphs arise naturally in many real-world applications including social networks, recommender systems, ontologies, biology, and computational finance. Traditionally, machine learning models for graphs have been mostly designed for static graphs. However, many applications involve evolving graphs. This introduces important challenges for learning and inference since nodes, attributes, and edges change over time. In this survey, we review the recent advances in representation learning for dynamic graphs, including dynamic knowledge graphs. We describe existing models from an encoder-decoder perspective, categorize these encoders and decoders based on the techniques they employ, and analyze the approaches in each category. We also review several prominent applications and widely used datasets and highlight directions for future research.},

  abstract = {Dynamic networks are used in a wide range of fields, including social network analysis, recommender systems and epidemiology. Representing complex networks as structures changing over time allow network models to leverage not only structural but also temporal patterns. However, as dynamic network literature stems from diverse fields and makes use of inconsistent terminology, it is challenging to navigate. Meanwhile, graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained a lot of attention in recent years for their ability to perform well on a range of network science tasks, such as link prediction and node classification. Despite the popularity of graph neural networks and the proven benefits of dynamic network models, there has been little focus on graph neural networks for dynamic networks. To address the challenges resulting from the fact that this research crosses diverse fields as well as to survey dynamic graph neural networks, this work is split into two main parts. First, to address the ambiguity of the dynamic network terminology we establish a foundation of dynamic networks with consistent, detailed terminology and notation. Second, we present a comprehensive survey of dynamic graph neural network models using the proposed terminology.},
